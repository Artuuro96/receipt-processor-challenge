# Receipt Processor Challenge

This API was done using Typescript, so in order to run it you can use the docker-compose.yml, the api runs in port 8080 by default, so you have to make sure you don't have any other process running on that port or if you prefer, you can set another port in the docker-compose.yml file.

## Requisites
Docker

### Using docker-compose.yml
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build`
